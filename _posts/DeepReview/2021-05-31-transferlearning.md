[What is transfer learning?]

Transfer Learning encompasses the concept of training the model by transferring the deep learning model learned for a specific task(such as classification, detection, segmentation, etc.) to another task.
It means to use some of the abilities of neural networks learned in a specific field to train neural networks used in similar or completely new fields.
Therefore, when creating a new model using an existing model, it is a method to improve the prediction with speeding up.
